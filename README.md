### Test File Location and Execution Instructions (Jest)

The test file for your React component using Jest is located in the same directory as your JavaScript file, and it is named `App.test.js`. It contains tests for the `App` component.

To run the tests using Jest, you can follow these steps.

- Make sure you have Jest installed as a development dependency in your project. If you haven't already, you can install it by running the following command:
 ```
 npm install --save-dev jest
```
- Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
- Run the following command to execute the tests:
```
  npm test
```
- jest will automatically look for files with a .test.js or .spec.js extension and execute the tests within those files.
- The test results will be displayed in the terminal or command prompt. You will see the output indicating the success or failure of each test case.
